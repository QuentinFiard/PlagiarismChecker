Folk theorems, least fixed point  theorems 

1.. Introduction 

In  this  paper  we search  for  the  theorem  on  which 
the  fixed  point  theory  of  recursion  is based.  This 

leads us to  a variety  of  sources,  and  the  difficulties 
encountered  suggest that  we are  in the  presence  of  a 

folk  theorem  as defined  by  David  Hare1  [ 181. 

In  Section  2 we examine  eight  textbooks  which 
are likely  to  be  primary  source  information  for  people 
interested  in the  so called  fixed  point  theory  of  recuc- 
sion.  In  these  3ooks  a more  or  less formalized  fixed 
point  theorem  is mentioned  as the  basis for  the 
semantics  of  recursive  definitions.  However  there  is 

substantial  disagreement  on  what  exactly  this  theorem 
is, when  it  was written  and  by  whom. 

In Section  3 we look  for  the  original  works  referred 
to  in the  textbooks.  We expose  the  factors  creating 
these  problems  and  finally  explain  most  of  the  dis- 
crepancies. 

In Section  4 we discuss an extension  of  the  folk 
theorem,  for  which  we find  similar  problems.  The 

further  theorems  found  are  also  relevant  to  Section  3. 

In this  paper  we only  talk  about  various  theorems, 
so only  an intuitive  understanding  of  mathematical 
notions  such  as continuity  and  partial  ordering  is 

necessary.  The  interested  reader  will find  definitions 
in the  references. 

* A preliminary version of this paper was presented at Australian Computer Science 

Conference, May 198 1 the 4th . 

2. The  folk statement of  the fried point theory of recursk  definitions 

We refer  to  David  Harel's paper  [ 181 for a full 
explanation  of what are folk theorems. We just give here some criteria that he established, making more 

precise the difference between a folk statement (infor- mal) and a folk theorem (formal): 

(i) A folk statement is the informal version of a theorem 

(or  theorems) which tends to be remem- 
bered  by  people  not working in the actual area of research relevant to this or those theorems. 

(ii) The effort involved in tracing back the actual theorem(s) behind the folk statement is far greater 
than that involved in reproving them. (iii) 

A real folktheorem will be reproved over the years again and again, an activity which is completely 

justified and which should be regarded as part of the culture. Therefore a folk theorem will often have 

many versions, (iv) The roots of a folk statement or theorem 
might be buried in SOSM obscure lecture notes, in a letter to an editor, or worse in a private communica- 
tion. David Hare1 suggested that a compilation of folk 
theorems could be made. We present here a candidate. We first give the statement, then try to find the 
theorem(s) on which it is based. The fundamental result providing the fixed point 
semantics of a recursive construct is frequently loosely worded as:

The function  defined by a recursive program is the fixed point of  e functional 

operator. 

This  statement will be referred to as the folk  stare- -t. 

take the naive approach of a reader, card the folk statement,  and who looks 
in various textbooks  for a mention  of the  theorem(s) to which the author relates the folk statement. 

Manna (26, p. 3701 bases the justification  for the folk statement  on Kleene's first recursion theorem 
given as follows. 

Wteorem 1. Every continuous  functional F has a least fixed point  which is lub {F*(l)} -. 

Bird [4, p.  1581 gives the same result but calls it 
Kleene's fixed point  theorem.  Milne and Strachey 129, p. 327-3281  refer 

to  a version  of Theorem  1 which they call the `Xnaster futed point  theorem". 

Theo~!m 2. Every continuous  function  F over a com- plete lattice has a least fixed point  which is lub { F"(1)). 

`#.!P 
A proof is given as part of a more  general  result 
[29,  p. 3301. in discussions leading up to this they mention  a theorem of Tarski [38] about fmed points 

of a monotonic  function  over a complete lattice, but do not  consider it further  as they are mainly inter- 
ested in continuous  functions. Stoy  136, p. 801 explains that  least fned  points of 

certain operators are required for the semantics of recursive definitions and observes that, by Tarski's 
theorem,  monotonicity  of the operators would be enough to guarantee the existence of least fixed 

points  [36, p. 971, But he goes on to say that  mono- tonic&y is not  a sufficient restriction to enable the 
solution of another (related) problem and finally (36, p.  1121 gives, without  credit, a version of 

Theorem 2 for countably  based continuous  complete lattices. 

Brady [8, p, 2291 indicates that  to guarantee the existence of a solution to recursive equations Scott 
1331 and Scott and Strachey  [ due to Tarski and Knaster whi 

continuous  function  over a complete  lattice  has a fIxed point".  Brady's reference for this result is to a 
paper by Soott [33] which gives a theorem  with credit to Tar&i only. Later 18, p. 2441 

Brady  men- tions the use of least fued 
points  and  refers  the reader to  Stoy for 
details. 
Livercy [ 25, p.  f 8] gives a version  of  Theorem  2 
and  an extension with  a very  indirect  reference  to Kleene. Cutland 

[ 14, p. 1921 cites  Kleene's  first recursion theorem given 

as follows:  every  recursive operator has a least fixed 

point  which is a comput- able function.  De Bakker [3, p. 1541 

bases the  seman- 
tics of recursive procedures  as least  fixed  points  on  a 

vcfsion of  Theorem  2 for  complete  partial  orderings 
(c.p.o.).  He gives Scott  credit  for  much  of  the  mathe- matics of this 

chapter,  particularly  the  results  on least fixed points  23, p. 4721. 

Also  he  gives Tarski's 
theorem  but  with  the  mention  that  it  has interest  for 

future  applications  [3, p.  1421. He  describes  Tarski's theorem as a 

lattice  theoretic  generalization  of  an old 
result  in set  theory  [24,  p. 4731.  Scott,  in As fore- 

word  to  Stay,  includes  the  following  quote  from  the 

draft  of  Milne and  Strachey : "The  relevant  theorems 
about  fued  points,  due  to  Knaster  and  Tarski  . . .". After 

examination  of  the  various  theorems  cited 
by  the  textbooks  it  becomes  apparent  that  the  folk 
statement  is based  on  the  following  theorem  (whose 
origins  we examine  in the  next  section). 

Theorem 3. Every continuous  function  F over  a c.p.0. 
has a least futed point which is lub {F"(l)} na- 

Observe  that,  strictly speaking, particular cases of this theorem  restricted to flat lattices 

or  complete 
lattices  are  appropriate  according  to  the  particular 

setting  in which  different  authors  develop  the  theory. 

For  instance,  Manna is dealing mainly  with  flat  lat- 
tices,  Milne and  Strachey  with  complete  lattices  and 

de Bakker  with  c.p.o.`s. 

3. Searching for the origins 

To solve the apparent  discrepancies  regarding  the 
origins  of  Theorem  3 we look  first  at  the  work  of 

Kleene,  Knaster  and  Tarski. The  fist  recursion  theorem  of  Kleene  [Z  p- 3481 

was ~NNWI to  him  before  1938  (see  for  example  his 

113 

Volume  14, number 3  INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS  16 May 1981 

comments  on  123, p.  3763 and  also  [13]).  It  is cor- 
rf?ctly given  by  Cutland.  Manna and  Bird give what  in 
fitct is a partial  version  of  this  theorem  which  in their 
setting  is more  appropriate  than  the  original  full  ver- 

sion. The  statement  of  the  theorem  in  [22]  mentions 
only  the  existence  of  a least fixed  point  but  the  proof 

uses an iterative  method  leading  to  its  characterization 
as lub {(F"(l))}. The  result  in  [24]  which  relates  to  this  work  is in 

fact  given as a lemma.  We translate  it  as follows. 
Theorem 4.  Every  monotonic  function  F over  sets such that  there exists a 

set A with F(A)  E  A has a 
fixed  point,  F(D)  = D, D 5  A. 

This result  was obtained  jointly  with  Tarski  as is 
stated  at  the  beginning  of  [24]  (see  also  [38,  footnote 
21). But  the  paper  contains  no  proof,  so we  do  not 
know  if this  fixed  point,  guaranteed  to  exist,  is the 
least one.  And  even  if it  is the  least  one  the  proof  may 
not  have given a lub  characterisation  to  it.  Also mon- 
otonic  functions  are  not  necessarily  ccntinuous. 

Therefore  Theorem  2 is not  due  to  Knaster. 

The  result  in  [38]  which  has been  mentioned  pre- 
viously  is the  following: 

Theorem 5. Every  monotonic  function  over  a com- 
plete  lattice  has a complete  lattice  of  fixed  points 
(and  hence  a least  fixed  point). 

This theorem  was obtained  by  Tarski  in  1939  (and 
discussed by  him  in a few  public  lectures  in  1939- 

1942 (see  [38,  footnote  21)). An abstract  appeared  in 
1949  [37].  Although  not  of joint  authorship  Theorem 
5 improves  the  earlier  result  of  Knaster  and  Tarski 
(Theorem  4)  and  is sometimes  referred  to  as the 

Knaster-Tarski  theorem  (e.g. see  [3 1, p.  1931). 

Theorem  5 was given in the  second  edition  of 
[S, p.  541. Birkhoff  also pointed  out  the  relationship 
between  this  result  and  earlier  work  of  Kantorovitch 

[21]  and Knaster  [24]  but  omitted  reference  to 
Tarski.  The  third  edition  of  [S, p.  1151 gives credit  to 
Tarski and  also  men lions  [20]  where  a version  of 
Theorem  3 is proved  m the  setting  of  ordered  linear 
spaces. 

Discussion. The  investigations  reported  above  lead  us 
to  make  the  claim  that  Theorem  3 is not  only  the 

114 

theorem  on  which  the  folk  statement  is based  but 
indeed  qualifies  as a folk  theorem. 

An important  ingredient  of  this  folk  theorem  is 
.he  lub characterisation it provides of the least faed 
point  of a continuous  function.  This may be con- trasted with Tarski's result (Theorem 5) in which he 

proves the existence of a least fixed point  but not  in a constructive way. From a denotational  point  of 

view this may be considered as sufficient, as we may unambiguously associate to each recursive construct 
a mathematical function  (its meaning) independently of any implementation.  The folk theorem  is restricted 

to  continuous  functions  but  provides a constructive proof of the existence of a least futed point  which is 

closely related to  a particular implementation.  There- fore from an operational point  of view it is more 
satisfactory than Tarski's theorem.  Most authors who cite both  theorems invariably attach more importance 

to the folk theorem  but sometimes Tarski's theorem is cited in a context  where the folk theorem  is 

intended. Now Theorem 5 appears at the beginning of  [38] 
but  20 pages further  on, in an easily overlooked dis- 
cussion  of  generalizations  of later results, Tar&i mentions  that  under certain conditions the  formuls 

lub {F"(I)}  yields a fixed point. 

So even  thou?& neither  Tarski nor Kleene expli- citly stated  the folk theorem  as a theorem it is clear 

that  they  knew the result, as did Kantorovitch and others. 

Perhaps this part of the tale is best concluded  with the name that Scott gave in an important  paper  1321 
to his version of the folk theorem  viz. "a well-known theorem". 

4.  Extensions of the folk theorem 

The  interest  which  we have seen above in general ordered spaces such as complete  lattices and in con- 
tinuous  functions comes from  developments in pro- gramming language semantics which enable the model- 
ling of features other  than recursion. However, there a& instances for example in the  study of unbounded 

nondeterminism,  and in considering fair parallelism where one may need monotonic  non-continuous 

functions  snd a constructive version of Tar-ski's 

Volume 14, number 3  INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS  16 May 1982 

theorem,  that  is the generalization of the folk theorem to monotonic  functions (see, for example,  [2,9]). 
Sonenberg  [35] has a list of other  references. 

This extension is obtained  by replacing the o  itera- tion by a transfmite iteration. 

Extended Folk Theomn 6 (with  ordinals). If f is a monotonic  function  from a complete lattice D into 
itself, there is an ordinal ~1 of cardinality less than  or equal to  that  of D such that fl>  CII *  the least fried 

point  off  is f@(l) where 1 is the bottom  element of the lattice and f"(l)  = f(U,,<h f@(l)) for all h > 

1, 
P(1)  = 1. 

This version was presented by Hitchcock and Park [19] in relation with a problem of termination  and 
independently  by Cadiou [IO]. Gallier, finding Hitch- cock and Park's proof too  sketchy,  reproves it in 

[ 161. Cousot and Cousot  [12] give a full treatment  of this 

theorem  and its corollaries and cite Devide [ 151 and Pasini [SO] as other authors proving this result. The 
following version of the extended  folk theorem makes it very similar to  a theorem  of Bourbaki 161. 
The difference being increasing functions  are used instead of monotonic  and the fixed point is not  neces- 

sarily the least, but is still canonical. 

Extended Folk  Theorem 7 (without  ordinals).  Let  f 
be  a monotonic  function  from  a chain  completed 

poset  D into  itself. f has a least fixed point  equal to the lub of a well ordered complete lattice S defined 

recursively as the smallest set satisfying: (i) 1 E s. 

(ii) If t E S, then f(t) E S. (iii) If T C S 

and lub  T exists,  then  lub  T E  S. 

In  fact  one  can argue  that  Bourbaki's  theorem  is 
on equal footing with Kantorovitch's, Kleene's and Tarski's as a foster parent to  the folk theorem, at 

least in the elementary setting of flat lattices. Indeed we want to approximate the  function  recursively 

defined by a sequence of better  and better approxi- mations, which means that  we are interested in the 

fact that  the operator is increasing. For this we need Bourbaki's theorem:  it provides a canonical faed 
point,  which is necessary for denotational  purposes and as 

discussed  by  Manna and  Shamir  [27] ; it does 
not  need  to  be  the  least.  And  as Markowsky  [28] 

has shown, the extended  folk  theorem  is a simple corollary to 

Bourbaki's. 
NOW the proof  of  Bourbaki's  theorem  appeared  in 
1950 with  the  following  mention:  This  theorem  was given, without  proof, eleven years before in 

"Ele- 
ments  de  la Thdorie  des Ensembles"  and  as readers  of 
this  book  kept  asking for  its proof  we finally  decided 
to  publish  it  even  though  it  is to  be found  in essence 

in Zermelo's  paper.  The  English edition  of  Bourbaki 

[7]  includes  an extensive  historical  note.  In  [7, p.  3261 it 

is noted  that  Dedekind  introduced  the  notion  of 
the  `chain' of  an element  a of  a set  E relative  to  a 

function  f  : E +  E, namely  fl  (K  s  E:  a E  K, f(K)  E 
K},  and  that  a notion  closely  related  to  this  forms  the 
basis of  Zermelo's  second  proof  of  his theorem  and 
also the  proof  of  Theorem  7. The  question  of  the 
origins of  Bourbaki's  theorem  is intimately  related  to 
that  for  many  maximal  principles  and  for  the  axiom 

of  choice.  Campbell  [ 111 gives a comprehensive 
account. 

The  interested  reader  will fmd  many  more  related 
fmed  point  theorems  in the  literature,  dating  back  at  `* 
least to  Cantor  (1897).  For  a history  of  futed  point 
theorems  in mathematical  analysis,  SCI: [17]. 

Let  us conclude  with  the  remark  tilat  the  Abian- 
Brown  theorem  [ 1 ]  seems to  be  the  most  general 
fured  point  theorem  from  which  one  can easily  derive 

Bourbaki's  theorem,  the  folk  theorem  and  its exten- 
sion.
